# podcast-adblocker

## The plan
1. Setup rss client using something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss-parser
2. See if https://github.com/adblockradio/adblockradio works off the shelf
3. Reserve using something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss-generator or just vanilla https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml-js library
4. Add endpoints/frontend to subscribe and unsubscribe from feeds
